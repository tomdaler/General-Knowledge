On Server 063 the driver for excel is for 32bits, and for .NET, to make it work, it has to set the building of the project to “Any CPU”.

On the other hand, on my laptop the driver installed is for 64bits, and to make it work on my laptop I have to set the project to work with “64 bits”


So, while I test the application on my laptop I have to set to 64bits , and when I copy the release to production I have to set to “Any CPU”

For this reason, if the driver is updated to 64bits on server 063 the rest of automations have to be rebuilt with the setting on their projects to “64 bits”
