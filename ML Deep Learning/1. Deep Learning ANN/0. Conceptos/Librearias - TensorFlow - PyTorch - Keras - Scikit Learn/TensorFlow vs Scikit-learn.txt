
TensorFlow is a library specific for tensor calculation and neural network, including deep learning. 
It can be used on deep learning, like image classification, text generation or reinforcement learning, 
but there's no method for general machine learning and statistics, like logistic regression, random forest or pca.

Scikit-learn provides more various methods for machine learning and statistics than TensorFlow. 
There are basic machine learning method, including decision tree and ensemble models, pca and clustering, and assessment methods. 
You can use scikit-learn for various purposes, though it has no method for deepest learning.
