
COMPARAR, 2 MUESTRAS DE 10 Y EVALUAR SI TIENEN MEDIAS SIMILARES EN UN 95%
10 MUESTRAS HOMBERS
10 MUESTRAS MUJERES
df = 10+10-2


We will create some dummy data and 
let’s assume that they represent the likes on Instagram for some male and female users in one day. 
We will see if there is any difference in their mean 
thus the number of likes the males do is bigger than the number of likes of females.


The Hypothesis
Let’s beging by setting up our two hypothesis.

Null Hypothesis (H0): Population mean for males – Population mean for females = 0
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Population mean for males – Population mean for females > 0

Now, let’s set our significance level to 0.05 or 5%. 
That means that if our outcome has less that 5% chance of occuring 
we will reject the Null Hypothesis.


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
from scipy.stats import t

seed(1)
df=pd.DataFrame({"female":np.random.randint(10, 100, size=10),"male":np.random.randint(10, 140, size=10)})
print(df.head())


  female  male
0      47    81
1      22    35
2      82    30
3      19   111
4      85    60


dof = 10+10-2 = 18 (2 muestras de 10, una de hombres y otra de mujeres)

OPTION 1:

se_male=df.std()['male']/np.sqrt(10)
se_female=df.std()['female']/np.sqrt(10)
sed=np.sqrt((se_male**2) + (se_female**2))

t_stat=(df.mean()['male'] - df.mean()['female'])/sed

print(t_stat)

1.4975967856987693


OPCION 2: CON Scipy

t_stat, p = ttest_ind(df['male'], df['female'])
print(f't={t_stat}, p={p}')

t=1.4975967856987693, p=0.15156916509799923

For right tail  p/2

This function returns the p-value for the two-tailed test and we want left-tailed.
What we can do is to run the following function with our t statistic and the DOF.

#right-tailed 
t.sf(t_stat, 18)

0.07578458254899961

Igual a p/2


#left-tailed 
#DOF =18
t.cdf(t_stat, DOF)

As we are getting 0.075 which is bigger than 0.05 
thus we will not reject the NULL Hypothesis.
