
1.	K-NN is a Supervised machine learning 
	while K-means is an unsupervised machine learning.

2.	K-NN is a classification or regression machine learning algorithm 
	while K-means is a clustering machine learning algorithm.

3.	K-NN is a lazy learner 
	while K-Means is an eager learner. 
	An eager learner has a model fitting that means a training step but a lazy learner does not have a training phase.

4.	K-NN performs much better if all of the data have the same scale 
	but this is not true for K-means.

El centroide de un cluster se define como el punto equidistante de los objetos pertenecientes a dicho cluster
