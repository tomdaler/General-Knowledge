
Using both incrases accuracy for intrusion detection.
First K-means and the second stage Naive-Bayes


K-Means is used to identify groups of samples that behave similarly and dissimilarly 
such as malicious and non-malicious activity in the first stage 

While Na√Øve Bayes is used in the second stage to classify all data into correct class category.


Naive Bayes is for classification. 
==================================
It is a supervised learning classification technoque
Which means, you give a training set with the right answers.
Creates the model to predict more data to predict the answer.


k-means is for clustering. 
==========================
It is an unsupervised learning problem 
Which means there isn't a right or wrong answer.
We do not know the class or labels for any data.
It is intended to find structure in data based on certain targeted requirements.

PROPOSE POSSIBLE CLUSTERS, SCENARIOS, 
WITH NEW DATA IT WILL CREATE A NEW SCENARIO OR AFFECTS THE MAGNITUD OF PREVIOUS SCENARIOS

For example
From data from different sensors shows how is the place.
Then we look for cluster these data points into the number of possible states for the place.
When with a new sensor reading we can predict the new states of the place.
